# SEC data analysis and summarization
providing insights into mutual fund investments and company financials

## The Mission
### Observe what stocks mutual funds own and track how that changes over time.
1. Which mutual funds are we tracking
2. Find their official ID number (CIK)
3. Use that ID to pull their holdings from the SEC
4. Analyze those reports to see what stocks/bonds they hold
5. Build insights

## Notes
To pull the ciks of the MF_O mutual funds (no duplicates (4842 entries)), 3628 entity ciks were found. This is using the web scraping tecnique. It took 27 mins and 22 secs.
