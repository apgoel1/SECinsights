# SEC data analysis and summarization
providing insights into mutual fund investments and company financials

## The Mission
### Observe what stocks mutual funds own and track how that changes over time.
1. Which mutual funds are we tracking
2. Find their official ID number (CIK)
3. Use that ID to pull their holdings from the SEC
4. Analyze those reports to see what stocks/bonds they hold
5. Build insights
